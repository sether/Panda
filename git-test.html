			<h3>The Problem with Semantic Layout</h3>
			<p>Testing out this Git repository thing</p>
			<p>And trying out a bit of semantic layout along the way.</p>
			<p>Mind you, a problem with the new HTML5 semantic tags is that the heritage browsers 
			don't have a clue what they are.</p>
			<p>Poor old ie7, for example, ain't never heard of header, article, section or footer 
			(and I suspect ie8 is in the same boat).</p>
			<p>Consequently, they just ignore them, that is to say, they display any code inside 
			them that they recognise, p tags, text and so on, but they ignore any styling you 
			might have applied to the semantic tags.</p>
			<p>So your page is displayed sans CSS.</p>
			<p>And, it should be recalled, you can't swap out tags with an ie conditional.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>One way I have fixed this in the past is to put a separate set of div tags inside the 
			HTML5 tags and apply the styling to those primitive divs in an ie conditional statement.</p>
			<p>That works, but you have to ask yourself, why bother using the HTML5 tags in the first place 
			when the good ol' div still works perfectly well?</p>
			<p>I'll have to read up on the case for semantic tags again - as I recall it's all about helping the crawlers 
			recognise stuff that is "likely to be syndicated" or some such thing....</p>

			<p>And I note that the big mobs aren't so worried about backwards compatibility now days anyway.</p>
			<p>For example, Google and Adobe didn't spare a thought for us old folk when they trashed support for 
			XP without warning or apology.</p>
			<p>Caused me no end of trouble, that has.</p>
